 * Hardcoded site identity. Edited by the developer who forks the
 * repo, never edited at runtime. Decision in ADR 0010 — branding/
 * identity stay in code; offerings + payment destination +
 * autorenewal toggle live in Postgres and are panel-editable.
 *
 * Renamed from `MERCHANT` in ADR 0016 to reflect that this is the
 * deployment-wide brand identity, not a per-user row in the
 * (now-renamed) `users` table.
 *
 * Update the values below for each fork. The shape is intentionally
 * narrow: anything that grows beyond identity probably belongs in
 * `messages/{es,en}.json` (copy) or `styles/_theme.scss` (visuals).
